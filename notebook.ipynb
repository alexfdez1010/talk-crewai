    "# **Desarrollando Agentes de IA con CrewAI en Python**  \n",
    "\n",
    "En esta presentación, exploraremos cómo **desarrollar agentes de IA** utilizando el framework **CrewAI** en Python. La presentación está estructurada con explicaciones teóricas y **ejemplos de código completamente ejecutables** en Markdown y Python.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Se cubrirán los siguientes temas:  \n",
    "- **Introducción a CrewAI**: ¿Qué es CrewAI y cuándo debería utilizarse? Beneficios en automatización y colaboración multi-agente.  \n",
    "- **Configuración del Entorno**: Instalación de CrewAI, configuración de Google AI Studio con el modelo **Gemini 2.0 Flash**, y uso de **LiteLLM** para la integración de modelos.  \n",
    "- **Conceptos Fundamentales de CrewAI**: Entendiendo `Crew`, `Agent`, `Tools`, y `Flows`.  \n",
    "- **Ejemplos Prácticos**: Desde un agente básico hasta un equipo de múltiples agentes utilizando herramientas personalizadas y flujos de trabajo estructurados.  \n",
    "- **Mejores Prácticas**: Recomendaciones para **optimizar el rendimiento, gestionar herramientas/flujos de trabajo eficientemente, y escalar** a proyectos más grandes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Introducción a CrewAI**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **¿Qué es CrewAI?**  \n",
    "CrewAI es un framework de código abierto que permite la **orquestación de equipos de agentes de IA** que colaboran entre sí. Cada agente es una **entidad potenciada por LLM** con un **rol y objetivo específico**, y CrewAI les permite trabajar **autónomamente** para completar tareas complejas.  \n",
    "\n",
    "En lugar de usar un **único asistente de IA**, CrewAI permite que múltiples agentes colaboren, cada uno especializándose en un rol diferente (*role-playing*), **comunicándose y cooperando** para resolver problemas de manera más efectiva.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **¿Cuándo es útil CrewAI?**  \n",
    "CrewAI es ideal para escenarios donde **un solo modelo de IA es insuficiente o ineficiente**. Algunos casos de uso incluyen:  \n",
    "- **Flujos de investigación automatizados**: Un agente **busca información**, otro **analiza datos**, y otro **resume** los hallazgos.  \n",
    "- **Asistentes inteligentes**: Un **asistente de IA multifuncional** donde diferentes agentes manejan **consultas especializadas** (por ejemplo, un asistente de programación, un analista financiero, un experto médico).  \n",
    "- **Automatización de flujos de trabajo**: Las tareas complejas pueden **dividirse en subtareas**, manejadas por diferentes agentes (como un equipo humano con diferentes roles).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Beneficios Clave de CrewAI para Automatización y Colaboración**  \n",
    "- **Colaboración especializada**: Cada agente puede tener un **rol y experiencia únicos**, permitiendo que múltiples **perspectivas y habilidades** se apliquen a un problema simultáneamente.  \n",
    "- **Automatización de tareas complejas**: Un **Crew** (equipo) de agentes puede **desglosar objetivos complejos** en pasos manejables y delegarlos al agente más adecuado.  \n",
    "- **Integración con herramientas externas**: CrewAI **soporta herramientas personalizadas** (*Tools*), como **búsquedas web, recuperación de datos, interacciones con API**, y **ejecución de código Python**, haciendo a los agentes mucho más poderosos.  \n",
    "- **Escalabilidad y flexibilidad**: Gracias a su diseño modular, puedes **agregar fácilmente más agentes**, **cambiar LLMs**, o **ajustar flujos de trabajo** sin reescribir todo. Además, con **LiteLLM**, puedes **cambiar entre proveedores de IA (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)** con cambios mínimos de configuración.  "

      "**Scale of Emissions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Variability:** Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs are highly variable. The amount depends on factors like the size and depth of the reservoir, the climate, the amount of organic matter in the flooded area and the watershed, and how the reservoir is managed.\n",
      "*   **Methane vs. CO2:** While both carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are emitted, methane is a more potent greenhouse gas in the short term. Methane is produced by the decomposition of organic matter in oxygen-poor environments at the bottom of reservoirs.\n",
      "*   **Comparison to Fossil Fuels:** On average, hydropower emits less GHGs than fossil fuel-based power generation. Hydro-Québec states that hydropower generation emits 35 times less GHGs than a natural gas generating station and about 70 times less than a coal-fired generating station. However, some studies show that, in specific cases, emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs can be comparable to those from thermal power plants, particularly in tropical regions with large reservoirs and high organic matter input. One estimate suggests that hydropower makes up at least 1.3 percent of total global carbon emissions.\n",

      "Several strategies are being researched and implemented to reduce GHG emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Selective Water Withdrawal:** Adjusting the depth from which water is drawn from the reservoir can significantly affect methane emissions. Drawing water closer to the surface can reduce emissions from methane degassing.\n",
      "2.  **Managing Organic Matter:** Reducing the amount of organic matter entering the reservoir can decrease methane production. This can involve better land management practices in the watershed, such as reducing deforestation and agricultural runoff. Tackling internal and external sources of organic matter supporting CH4 production in reservoirs is key.\n",
      "3.  **Methane Capture:** Capturing methane released from the reservoir and using it as a fuel source is another potential mitigation strategy.\n",
      "4.  **Biomass Removal:** Clearing biomass before flooding a reservoir site has been used for mitigation, though its effectiveness is debated.\n",
      "5.  **Reservoir Aeration:** Increasing dissolved oxygen concentrations in reservoirs can reduce methane production.\n",
      "6.  **Improved Modeling and Monitoring:** Developing better models to predict GHG emissions and monitoring emissions from reservoirs can help identify effective mitigation strategies.\n",

      "Okay, here's the data I've compiled on renewable energy options for urban settings, focusing on your key criteria:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Rooftop Solar**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Space Requirements:** Rooftop solar utilizes existing building space, minimizing additional land use. Space needs depend on energy goals and roof size. NREL estimates a potential of roughly 30 GW from new construction and roof replacements annually.\n",
      "*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Installation costs vary. The cost of installing a solar photovoltaic (PV) system can be offset within 4–7 years by savings on traditional electricity bills. Government subsidies and incentives can significantly improve cost-effectiveness. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is also decreasing, making it more competitive.\n",
      "*   **Environmental Impact:** Minimal direct emissions during operation. Reduces the need for new transmission infrastructure. Some concerns exist regarding the environmental impact of manufacturing and disposal of solar panels. A study in Kolkata indicated city-wide installation could increase daytime temperatures by up to 1.5°C.\n",
      "*   **Energy Output/Efficiency:** Efficiency ranges from 15% to over 20% for commercially available panels. Output depends on panel size, sunlight availability, and orientation. Solar generation growth is significant. For example, Texas solar generation grew by 25% from 2022 to 2023.\n",

      "**Introduction**\n",
      "\n",
      "Urban environments present unique challenges and opportunities for renewable energy deployment. High population density, limited space, and specific environmental concerns necessitate a careful evaluation of different renewable energy technologies. This report compares solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, focusing on their suitability for urban settings, considering efficiency, cost, space requirements, and environmental impact. Recommendations are provided based on current data and trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Solar Energy**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Technology Overview:** Solar energy technologies capture sunlight and convert it into electricity. Key innovations include perovskite solar cells, bifacial panels, transparent solar panels, and solar windows.\n",
      "*   **Urban Suitability:** Solar energy is highly adaptable to urban environments, primarily through rooftop installations and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).\n",
      "*   **Space Requirements:** Utilizes existing building space, minimizing additional land use. NREL estimates a potential of roughly 30 GW from new construction and roof replacements annually.\n",
      "*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** The cost of installing a solar photovoltaic (PV) system can be offset within 4–7 years by savings on traditional electricity bills. Government subsidies and incentives can significantly improve cost-effectiveness. Decreasing levelized cost of energy (LCOE) makes it increasingly competitive.\n",
      "*   **Environmental Impact:** Minimal direct emissions during operation and reduces the need for new transmission infrastructure. The environmental impact of manufacturing and disposal of solar panels is a concern. A study in Kolkata indicated a potential increase in daytime temperatures by up to 1.5°C with city-wide installation.\n",
      "*   **Energy Output/Efficiency:** Efficiency ranges from 15% to over 20% for commercially available panels. Output depends on panel size, sunlight availability, and orientation. Solar generation growth is significant; for example, Texas solar generation grew by 25% from 2022 to 2023.\n",
      "*   **Market Trends:** Significant growth in solar PV, driven by decreasing costs and increasing efficiency. Solar surpassed 2023's record installations in 2024, adding an estimated 39.6 gigawatts (GW) of capacity, compared to 27.4GW in 2023. Continued growth in residential solar adoption, along with increased use of AI and automation in solar operations. Battery storage integration is taking center stage, allowing excess energy to be stored and used when sunlight is unavailable.\n",
      "*   **Challenges:** Intermittency (reliance on sunlight availability), economic and financial barriers (high initial costs), and environmental costs of production.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Wind Energy**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Technology Overview:** Wind turbines convert wind energy into electricity. Innovations include larger turbines, advanced blade designs, floating offshore wind turbines, and bladeless wind turbines.\n",
      "*   **Urban Suitability:** Urban wind turbines are typically smaller than utility-scale turbines and can be mounted on rooftops or integrated into building designs. However, wind resources can be lower and more turbulent in urban environments.\n",
      "*   **Space Requirements:** Space requirements vary greatly depending on the design and size of the turbine.\n",
      "*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Variable, depending on wind resources, turbine design, and installation costs. The cost per kilowatt for onshore wind energy worldwide averaged $1,160 in 2023. Operation and maintenance can cost $42,000-$48,000 per year for larger turbines.\n",
      "*   **Environmental Impact:** Potential noise pollution and visual impact are significant concerns. Wind energy has dramatically lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels.\n",

      "**Overview:**\n",
      "\n",
      "In late February and early March 2025, the Trump administration implemented a series of tariff actions primarily targeting Canada and Mexico, with China also implicated. These actions involved initial tariff impositions, followed by partial reversals, temporary exemptions, and threats of new tariffs on specific sectors. The stated reasons varied but often involved trade imbalances, national security concerns (including drug trafficking), and long-standing disputes (e.g., Canadian dairy policies).\n",

      "The Trump administration's tariff actions in late February and early March 2025, while initially met with mixed reactions, present several potential positive outcomes for the United States. These actions, involving tariffs on imports from countries including Canada, Mexico and China, are rooted in the administration's commitment to protecting national security, addressing trade imbalances, and ensuring fair trade practices for American industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Positive Developments and Justifications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Strengthening National Security:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   The tariffs implemented under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) are justified by the administration as necessary to safeguard U.S. national security. This includes addressing concerns related to drug trafficking and protecting vital domestic industries. By using tariffs, the administration aims to create a more secure economic environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Addressing Trade Imbalances and Ensuring Fair Trade:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   A core objective of the tariff actions is to rectify long-standing trade imbalances that the administration believes disadvantage American businesses. By imposing tariffs, the administration seeks to level the playing field and encourage fairer trade practices from key trading partners like Canada, Mexico and China. Specific grievances, such as Canada's high tariffs on dairy products and lumber, are being directly addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Protecting American Industries and Jobs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   The tariffs on steel and aluminum, and other imports, are designed to protect American industries from foreign competition and prevent the erosion of domestic jobs. By increasing the cost of imported goods, the tariffs incentivize consumers and businesses to purchase American-made products, thereby stimulating domestic production and employment. The temporary reprieves and exemptions offered also demonstrate a nuanced approach, allowing for adjustments that support specific sectors compliant with agreements like the USMCA.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Negotiating Leverage for Better Trade Deals:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   The threat of new tariffs, such as the potential 250% tax on Canadian dairy products, serves as a powerful negotiating tool. These threats create an incentive for Canada and other countries to engage in constructive dialogue and make concessions that benefit American interests. The administration's willingness to take decisive action strengthens its position in trade negotiations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Potential for Long-Term Economic Benefits:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   While initial reactions to the tariffs may include market unease, the long-term potential benefits include increased domestic production, reduced reliance on foreign imports, and a more resilient American economy. The administration believes that these tariffs will ultimately lead to a more balanced and sustainable trade relationship with key partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Trump administration's tariff actions in early 2025 reflect a strategic effort to prioritize American national security, promote fair trade, and protect domestic industries. While the immediate impact may involve adjustments and retaliatory measures, the administration is confident that these actions will yield significant long-term benefits for the United States, fostering a more secure and prosperous economic future.
